# Diffusion_Model_QA_Dashboard
Diffusion Model QA Dashboard is a visual tool to evaluate and monitor the quality of image outputs generated by diffusion models. It supports automated and manual QA through metrics, comparisons, prompt tracking, and failure case analysis, helping improve model performance and reliability.

# 🖼️ Diffusion Model QA Dashboard

An interactive dashboard for evaluating the quality of images generated by diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion, DALL·E, or custom-trained generative models. It helps researchers and developers track, compare, and assess model outputs across various prompts and conditions.

## 📌 Project Description

**Diffusion Model QA Dashboard** is a visual quality assurance tool designed to streamline the evaluation process for image generation models. It enables automated and manual analysis of outputs based on visual fidelity, prompt relevance, diversity, and failure detection. The dashboard supports batch evaluation, comparison views, scoring metrics, and result export, making it ideal for R&D, benchmarking, and regression testing of generative AI pipelines.

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 Visualize and compare generated images by prompt or model version
- 🧠 Score outputs based on semantic alignment, realism, and quality
- ❌ Identify failure cases (e.g., hallucination, artifacts, prompt mismatch)
- 📂 Upload & browse datasets of generated images
- 📈 Export evaluation logs and summaries
- 🛠️ Easy integration with any diffusion model pipeline
